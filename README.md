# Records-of-CSAPP
records in the process of reading CS:APP
Nowadays, I'm reading CS:APP, a classical book in CS writeen by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron(CMU). And I create the repo for storing my records in the  process of reading CS:APP.

And in the repo there are some material downloaded from Internet that help me do better. These are for personal use. The website is http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/.
